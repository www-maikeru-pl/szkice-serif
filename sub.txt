(indistinct voices)
Boy.
Lovely boy.
What do you want?
A man has a thirst.
The man does not drink for a day and a night.
A boy could make a friend.
I have friends.
Give us a beer. Before I skin you.
A man does not choose his companions.
These two, they have no courtesy.
A man must ask forgiveness.
You're called Arry.
This man has the honor to be Jaqen H'ghar.
Once of the Free City of Lorath.
Hey, you little shit.
Get us beer!
You should have asked nicely.
Come closer.
And I'll shove that stick up your bunghole and fuck you bloody.
The boy has more courage than sense.
Come here!
Yoren said none of us were should go near of those three.
They don't scare me.
Then you're stupid.
They scare me.
Would a gold collector look this far from King's Landing?
What are you doing?
They're looking for me.
You're in command here?
You're a long way from home.
I asked you a question.
Aye, you did.
You asked without manners.
And I chose not to answer.
I have a royal warrant.
For one of these gutter rats you're transporting.
Well the thing is,
these gutter rats belong to the Night's Watch now.
That puts them beyond the reach of kings and queens.
It's a funny thing.
People worry so much about their throats,
they forget about what's down low.
Now I sharpened this blade before breakfast.
I could shave a spider's arse if I wanted to.
Or,
I could nick this artery in your leg
and once it's nicked, there's no one around here who knows how to un-nick it.
We'll just keep that.
Good steel is always needed on the wall.
Seems you have a choice.
You can die here at this crossroads a long way from home.
Or you can go back to your city and tell your masters
you didn't find what you were looking for.
We're looking for a boy named Gendry.
He carries a bull's head helmet.
Anyone turning him over will earn the King's reward.
We'll be back. With more men.
And I'll be taking your head home along with that bastard boy.
(Tyrion whistling)
(woman laughing)
My lord.
You make me wait a long time.
And your friend keeps me company.
We were just speaking of your bravery
in the victory against the Stark auxiliary forces.
It was quite a battle.
I heard you suffered a terrible head wound.
The northerners are such fearsome warriors.
And I tell him the story of how we meet.
To find such a lovely creature working in your father's kitchen.
It almost beggars belief.
Strange things do happen.
You should taste her fish pie.
I don't think Lord Varys likes fish pie.
How can you tell?
I can always tell.
Men like Lord Varys and I can't let our disadvantages get the best of us.
We'll make a fisherman of him yet.
I am glad your new friend was able to accompany you to the capital.
Friends are such an important part of life.
Unfortunate that your father didn't want her to come.
But rest easy my lord,
I am very good at keeping secrets for my good friends.
Your discretion is legendary,
where your friends are concerned.
How unspeakable of me to go on and on, when all you want to do is rest.
I will leave you.
Welcome to Kings Landing, my dear.
The city is made brighter by your presence.
We have a council meeting, my lord.
I don't like threats.
Who threatened you?
I'm not Ned Stark. I understand the way this game is played.
Ned Stark was a man of honor. And I am not.
Threaten me again and I will have you thrown into the sea.
You might be disappointed in the results.
The storms come and go.
The big fish eat the little fish.
And I keep on paddling.
Come, my lord.
We shouldn't keep the queen waiting.
From this time until the end of time, we are not part of your realm,
but a free and independent Kingdom of the North.
He has more spirit than his father, I'll give him that.
You've perfected the art of tearing up papers.
Give him his father's bones back, at least as a gesture of good faith.
You'll give the Starks our reply, cousin?
I will, Your Grace.
Did you see my brother when you were the Starks guest?
I did.
They have not broken his spirit, Your Grace.
If you speak with him,
tell him he's not been forgotten.
I will, Your Grace.
Safe travels, cousin.
You have a deft hand with diplomacy.
If that's everything?
A raven flew in this morning from Castle Black.
Trouble with the wildlings?
That's why they're called wildlings.
Somewhat less wild these days.
It seems they've stopped killing each other and started following this
King-Beyond-the-Wall.
Another king? How many is that now? Five? I've lost count.
Lord Commander asks that we send more men to man The Wall.
Perhaps he's forgotten we're fighting a war. We have no men to spare.
Cold winds are rising, and the dead rise with them.
The northerners are a superstitious people.
According to the Commander, one of these dead men attacked him in his chambers.
Mormont doesn't lie.
How do you kill a dead man?
Apparently you burn him.
One trip to The Wall and you come back
believing in grumpkins and snarks.
I don't know what I believe,
but here's a fact for you.
The Night's Watch is the only thing that separates us
from what lies beyond the Wall.
I have every confidence the brave men of the Night's Watch will protect us all.
Night, sir.
The gods wanted us to have dignity,
wouldn't make us fart when we died.
We fart when we die?
My blessed mother was holding her own when she left this world.
She farted so hard, the whole bed shook.
(farting noises)
Seems a bit greedy for one man to have so many wives.
We were having a serious discussion.
Wouldn't two or three be enough for him?
Would you look at that.
Nothing like the sight of a woman walking away.
I prefer watching them come towards me.
I'm sure that's nice too.
Well, there was a milkmaid
named Violet on the next farm over from where I grew up.
And we were wrestling together from the time we were six years old.
And then we got older,
the wrestling, uh ï¿½changed.
You were with her?
How many times?
Well, as many times as I could.
Wish I'd grew up on a farm.
We need more potatoes.
I'll get another sack for the sludge.
Get the turnips too.
No, Ghost, no!
No.
Ghost, away. Shoo. Shoo!
You all right?
- Did he frighten you?
- You shouldn't touch me.
Oh, oh. Right.
I'm sorry. I just wanted to make sure you weren't hurt.
You're very brave.
What's he doing?
This is Gilly,
she's one of Craster's daughters.
Hello, Gilly. What's he doing?
Sam said you could help.
I'm sorry, Sam knows we're not supposed...
She's pregnant.
We have to take her with us, when we leave.
What?
I know it sounds a bit mad.
No it doesn't sound a bit mad, it's impossible.
- The Lord Commander...
- We are sworn to protect.
- Sam we can't take her.
- Please sir, please.
I can still run if I have to.
It's just not possible.
I'm going to have a baby, if it's a boy I...
If it's a boy, what?
You want us to risk our lives for you, and you won't even tell us why.
Why did you do that?
Do what, ask her a question?
- You were cruel.
- Cruel!?
Sam are you in such a hurry to lose a hand?
- I didn't touch her!
- No you just want to steal her,
what do you think Craster cuts off for that?
I can't steal her,
she's a person not a goat.
We're heading deeper and deeper into wildling territory.
We can't take a girl with us.
Mormont wouldn't have it. And even if he would,
what would we do with her?
Who's gonna deliver her baby? You?
I could try...
What? I've read about it.
A bit.
I'm sorry Sam,
we can't help her.
Khaleesi.
- You don't need to see this.
- He is blood of my blood.
Who did this?
Khal Pono perhaps,
Khal Jhaqo...
They don't like the idea of a woman leading a Khalasaar.
They will like it far less when I'm done with them.
Is it as you remember my lord?
Looks smaller.
Everything looks bigger when you're a child.
I remember my father's cabin, felt like a palace when I was little.
Now look at it...
They'll be waiting for me on the docks.
Who will?
Anyone who matters,
this is a big day for them.
They haven't had much to get excited about since I left.
It's a hard place the Iron Islands...
